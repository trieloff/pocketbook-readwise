Readwise is a service that allows to store highlights from books.
It has an API that is documented at https://readwise.io/api_deets

Pocket Book is an e-reader. When connected to a computer, it is mounted at
/Volumes/PB700K3/ with exported notes in the /Volumes/PB700K3/Notes/ directory

Each book is one HTML file, and there can be duplicates of the same book, in which
case the newest file should be used.

Create a script that I can run whenever pluggin in my Pocket Book device that will
upload new highlights to Readwise.

Try to avoid duplications and speed up repeated uploads
